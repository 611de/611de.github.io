## Blog Building Process
If you're interested in building a similar blog, you can refer to the following steps:
1. **Select a Theme**: Go to the Jekyll official website's theme page (http://jekyllthemes.org/) to pick a theme you like. I chose the [JEKYLL YAT THEME](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/jekyll-theme-yat/), and its GitHub address is [https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat/](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat/). After selecting the theme, visit the theme's GitHub repository address, fork the theme, and change the repository name to your own.
2. **Set Up GitHub Pages**: Enter the repository, click on `Settings` on the page, and you can see `GitHub Pages` on the left. Make some simple settings to deploy your web page.
3. **Configuration**: There is a `_config.yml` file in the repository, which is used to configure blog information. You can change information such as `title`, `email`, `description`, and `favicon` to your own. The template recommends an online `favicon` tool, [Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/), which can generate icons for desktop, web, iOS, and Android simultaneously. After making the modifications, submit the changes. GitHub will automatically redeploy the new content, which usually takes about one or two minutes. You can view the deployment process and history on the `GitHub Actions` page of the GitHub repository.
4. **Write a Blog**: Write blog articles in `markdown` format in the `_post` folder. Note that the name format of the `.md` file should follow the pattern of **date + title**. After writing, submit the changes to the GitHub repository, and the blog will be automatically deployed and updated.
