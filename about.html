<p>Hey, nice to meet youüëè, you found this. this is Liuyiyi's personal blog</p>

<p>My name is Liu Yiyi. I'm living in Shanghai, China.
    I am learning Generative Artificial Intelligence and will share some new learning experiences</p>

<h4>Technologies</h4>
<p>I believe that one should not have a fixed technology stack, but should always respond to the needs and
    problems of the customer.
    Below is just an excerpt and my favorite technologies in machine learning, cloud and non-ML
    frameworks.<br />
    Django, Redis, ..., Pytorch, Spring boot, Angular, ECS...
